This is a fork of wicked-good-xpath, an MIT licensed project
from Google.

Original URL: http://code.google.com/p/wicked-good-xpath/

This snapshot was taken at r16.

It contains significant modifications to its core to the
core Node and FunctionCall files to instead strongly
bind against the WTF analysis DB. The WGX guys didn't want
a nice abstraction layer, unfortunately :(

There are local changes here to enhance the abstraction layer
and isolate changes to only those two file areas that will
eventually make it back into WGX.



Removed files:
- export.js
- *_deps.js
- test/
- *_test.html
- ieAttrWrapper.js

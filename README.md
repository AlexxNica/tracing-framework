Web Tracing Framework
================================================================================

The Web Tracing Framework is an set of libraries, tools, and visualizers for
the tracing and invegistation of complex web applications. You spend a small
amount of time instrumenting your code and it helps you discover performance
problems, track regressions, and build buttery-smooth 60fps web apps.

This is still very much a work in progress, and not yet ready for general
consumption. Once ready, much of the functionality will be available via
browser extensions and embeddable minified js files, but for now they aren't
going to be published.

## Setup

See [building](https://github.com/google/tracing-framework/blob/master/docs/building.md) for a quickstart, and
[testing](https://github.com/google/tracing-framework/blob/master/docs/testing.md) for information on running the various tests.
